# Job-Portal
A job portal is an online platform that connects job seekers with employers, allowing individuals to search for job opportunities and submit applications, while providing companies with a space to post job openings and manage recruitment. These portals often include a variety of features to enhance the job search and hiring process.

1. Job Posting by Employers
Company Account: Employers (companies or recruiters) create accounts on the job portal.
Job Listings: They post detailed job openings, including job title, description, requirements, location, and salary range.
Filtering Options: Employers can add criteria like experience level, education, skills, and even location preference.
Application Management: Many portals allow employers to manage applications, filter candidates, and communicate with them directly.
2. Profile Setup by Job Seekers
Personal Account: Job seekers create an account and profile with details like their resume, education, work experience, skills, and contact information.
Profile Visibility: Some portals allow job seekers to make their profiles public so employers can find and contact them directly.
Preferences: Job seekers can set up job preferences (location, job role, salary expectations), which helps in receiving targeted job recommendations.
3. Job Search Functionality
Search Filters: Job seekers use filters to narrow down job listings (by location, industry, job title, experience level, etc.).
Keyword Search: They can search using specific keywords relevant to the job title or skills.
4. Application Process
Apply Directly: Job seekers can often apply directly through the portal by clicking an "Apply" button.
Resume Submission: They may be required to upload a resume or fill out an online form.
Tracking Applications: Some portals allow candidates to track their application status (applied, shortlisted, rejected, etc.).
5. Notifications and Alerts
Job Alerts: Many portals offer job alerts based on the job seeker’s preferences, sent by email or through the portal’s app.
Status Updates: Candidates may receive updates on their application status or interview requests from employers.
6. Additional Features
Resume Builder: Some portals provide resume templates and tools.
Skill Assessments: Certain portals offer skill-based assessments, which employers can use to evaluate candidates.
Career Advice: Many job portals provide resources like articles, tips, or webinars on job search strategies, interview preparation, and industry insights.
